  <h2>Complete Payment</h2>
  <p>This site expects PayPal payments to be processed server-side. After successful payment your account should be marked <strong>paid</strong> by a secure server webhook, which sets <code>users/{uid}.paid = true</code> in Firestore.</p>
  <p>If you are testing locally, admins can mark a user as paid using the Admin page.</p>
